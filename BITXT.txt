move all file from one folder to other folder
1>first in control flow 
take Foreach Loop Container->double Click -> Collection ->secect (Foreach File Enumerator)
give source folder configuration name(E:\sem_9\BI\kruti_assignment\Level-1)
into variable mappings tab => create variable 
  variable    index
  User:Variable 0
2> take file system task into foreach loop container
   general tab
     isDestinationPathVariable  => False
     DestinationConnection => create destination connection
     select Operation
     IsSourcePathVariable => true
     SourceVariable => User:Variable

LEVEL-2
Points Covered:  Execute SQL Command, Look up, Derived Column, Multicast

Task 1 : Import data from .csv/.txt/excel/xml file to SQL table,
•	Sync the data into the table. 
◦	If PRIMARY KEY already exists in the table then UPDATE the data in the table.
◦	If new PRIMARY KEY is found in the file which does not exist in the table, INSERT the data into the table.
◦	And if an PRIMARY KEY in Table does not exist in the file, DELETE the data from the table.
•	Calculate Age based on DateOfBirth
•	Address data should be imported in “Address” table.

      

1.take data flow task -> doble click

2.take 
    . flat file source
    .OLEDB Source

*Flat File Source Flow
    .take data conversion and convert data accordingly
      and give colum alias as csv ex:name(csv) 
     .take multicast and derived column and dataconvrsion
      one point of multicast goes into dataconversion(1) and second into derived column
    Derived column : calculate age 
    (
      derived column name : age
      derived column : add as new column
       Expression :DATEDIFF("yy",[DateOFBirth(csv)],GETDATE())
        Data type : four-byte signed integer
     ) 

    from data conversion(1)
    take OLE DB Destination and add data of address field do not check other fields

   continue to derived colum :
     take one sort -> by id -> input from derived column
     take another sort -> by id -> input from oledb data source
    take Merge join -> input from sort and sort 1
     in mearge join select rows which we need and (relation sort ID(csv) mapping Sort1 ID)
 *take conditional split
      take input from merge join
       1>insert:ISNULL(ID) && !ISNULL([ID(csv)])
       2> delete:ISNULL([ID(csv)]) && !ISNULL(ID)
       3>update:Name != [Name(csv)] || Gender != [Gender(csv)]

take one OLEDB Destination -> for insert
   take two OLEDB Command -> for update and delte
   in colum mapping select column required for doing opertaion
    into component properties write commnd
    delete:delete from LEVEL2_Name where ID=?
    update:update LEVEL2_Name set Name=?,Gender=?,DateOfBirth=?,InvestAmount=? where ID=?
